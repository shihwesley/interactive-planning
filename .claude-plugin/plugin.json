  "description": "Structured planning for Claude Code with interactive decision gates. Walks through requirements gathering, approach selection, and plan validation before any code is written. Two modes: task-based (single plan file with sequential phases) for straightforward features, and spec-driven (multi-file specs with dependency DAG, topological sprint grouping, and two-level task tracking) for complex multi-domain work. Includes session recovery, auto-detection of complex tasks, and checkpoint protocols for error escalation.",
